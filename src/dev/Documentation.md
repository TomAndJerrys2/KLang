KLang - By Kyle Brady

This is a short documented overview of the language in question, klang. A Mid-Level Language
built on C, with it's main features and inspiration drawing from C++ and Rust. I wanted to make
a language more for the learning aspect more than anything. Language and Compiler design are 
something I dreamt about long before I could properly write any program.

Languages in general fascinated me - their complexion and ability to take random data
and give it meaning is certainly interesting, to say the least it sparked my interest the
more I thought about it. Generally, words have no meaning - they're only sprung into usefulness
when they are assigned some meaning. Just like in mathematics and most things.

While I wont go to deep into all the nooks and cranny's of how KLang is compiled / ran. I believe
that's better for something more robust and informational. This was left here in this folder to give passerby's or potential recruiter's ;), an insight into the language. While there is a full
documentation that goes into more depth, this is intended as a Quick learning guide. We will go over the syntax, the language's features, its built in goodies and secrets ;) and why I bothered
to build something that people wont use - so let's start with that!

KLang was built out of fascination and a chance to learn deeper and richer knowledge. As explained
before, a passion project merely. If it turns into something good then it will follow the river
and go with the current. However, nothing is meant to be taken seriously. As in, the language
isn't super optimized down to it's core. While the language is optimized and compiled making faster than most interpreted languages, this does not give it a natural head-start on other languages, this goes against it for other toy languages too. The syntax is also personal choice
and was not meant to fit a specific purpose or make any process easier (although in my opinion it definitely does).

My Goal however despite being something on the side. Was to make a fast and most importantly
safe language that had a more fluid syntax structure. Another big thing was to make the overhead
as little as possible and preferably more lightweight

The language itself in terms of syntax and features are very easy to understand. The Easier 
it is to understand, the better it is.

# - Types -

KLang features a few different types most being standard with a few niche changes - each integral type (including characters) has an associated signed or unsigned type which class as different 
keywords to the compiler:

-> Since KLang isn't supported by GitHub - yet :)) - the syntax highlighting will use the same
as C for reference, as its the language that KLang is built from and draws from.

```c
// - KLang -

// Common Types
Int // Represents Generic number
Char // Represents an ASCII character or its associated numerical value
Double // Represents a large decimal
Float // Represents a small
String // Represents a set of characters
Bool // represents a true or false value

/* all integral types are signed by default - to each numerical type
 * there is an unsigned counterpart, as its own keyword specifying positive values only.
 * using the prefix "u" there exists: uint, uchar, udbl, ufloat
*/

```

```c
// - KLang -

// Special Types
null // absence of an assigned value
any // resembles a type of any integral value
void // a type that has yet to be casted
