# KLang

# <i>A Mid-Level, Multi-functional Language</i>

KLang was made as a side-project inspired by the will and curiosity of the cogs and wheels that drive the everyday compiler.
Since picking up the interest it's been interesting to see how each piece works and how, eventually, it does all fit together
in a nice neat picture. While not necessary, KLang was made to support an array of functions from Web development all the way
to Game Development and Database management. The Syntax and Compile resemnble and are built from C. Pure C. Nothing more or
nothing less was needed. While the language itself bears features to others like rust and C++, it keeps in its own lane and
hopefully has some use for problem's I have yet to encounter. Mabye for you too.
