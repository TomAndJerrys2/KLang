# KLang

# <i>A Mid-Level, Multi-functional Language</i>

KLang was made as a side-project inspired by the will and curiosity of the cogs and wheels that drive the everyday compiler.
Since picking up the interest it's been interesting to see how each piece works and how, eventually, it does all fit together
in a nice neat picture. While not necessary, KLang was made to support an array of functions from Web development all the way
to Game Development and Database management. The Syntax and Compile resemnble and are built from C. Pure C. Nothing more or
nothing less was needed. While the language itself bears features to others like rust and C++, it keeps in its own lane and
hopefully has some use for problem's I have yet to encounter. Mabye for you too.

# Goals
- Strongly Typed, memory safe definitions
- Optimized allocations and reallocations
- Multi-Thread built in capability
- Standard Library with Features - but no exclusive to: sockets, http, math, memory, types, algorithm, structure and more
  - Libraries and included features are explained in each documented piece
- Fast and Efficient Compiler with Human-Readable error messages and integrated assistance (intellisense, highlighting etc.)
- In-Built Data structure and algorithm processing.
- Direct access to Memory, System calls and Managing Sys process such as Networking.

These goals are to keep the build motivating and exciting. A Modest goal in my mind would be to make a fast and lightweight
language that has a more than capable strength of building an array of applications. Whether it be for websites, gaming or 
desktop applications. All tools should be available in one place.
